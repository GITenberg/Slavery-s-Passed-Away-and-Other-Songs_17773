1. Oh child come to me and just sit down by my knee,<br />
I'll tell that same old story just once more;<br />
Of dark, clouded years, oh, so full of bitter tears,<br />
In those bondage days of long before the war.<br />
In rice-field and in cane, there the black man felt the pain,<br />
The driver's whip it cut him ev'ry day;<br />
Our good Lord above, with his never dying love,<br />
Made that cruel, cruel slavery pass'd away.<br />
<br />
2. Oh child, in those times then I liv'd among the pines,<br />
Yes, in an old log cabin I was born;<br />
Then I heard the moan when the mothers lost their own,<br />
In those bondage days, oh thank the Lord they're gone.<br />
That Iron chain and band they grow rusty in this land,<br />
No more the blood hound hold the slave at bay;<br />
So we bend the knee to the Lord that made us free,<br />
For that cruel, cruel slavery pass'd away.<br />
<br />
3. Oh I don't complain, it will never come again,<br />
So all our little children, black and brown;<br />
They ne'er can be sold for that yellow shining gold,<br />
For sweet Freedom, child, she has put on her crown.<br />
She came here in the night, oh then might gave in to right,<br />
Old Abra'm Lincoln brought about the stay;<br />
So shout Hallelu&mdash;there's a lot of work to do,<br />
For that cruel, cruel slavery pass'd away.<br />
</p>

<span class="i0">Oh shout Hallelujah, Freedom ever rules the land,<br /></span>

1. 'Twas many years ago I left de sunny South, to roam<br />
Up North, de happy day dat I was free;<br />
From massa an' ole missus, too, and all de folks at home,<br />
Whose faces now I neber more shall see;<br />
I'se trabeled night and day to see de dear old place once more;<br />
De cotton fields, de ribber, and de mill;<br />
But most of all, where I was born, in happy days before,<br />
In de little log cabin on de hill!<br />
<br />
2. Oh, I remember ebry day, when all our work was o'er,<br />
We'd hear de bones' and banjos' sweet refrain,<br />
While all de darkies danc'd and swung around de cabin door;<br />
Dem happy times will neber come again;<br />
We'd hunt de possum and de coon until de mornin' fair,<br />
An' laugh and shout, so gay and jolly still;<br />
Such joyous, happy darkies, an' we had no tho't of care,<br />
In de little log cabin on de hill!<br />
<br />
3. Upon de ole plantation there is no one left I know;<br />
De folks are wand'ring all so far away,<br />
An' strangers meet me ebrywhere, yes, ebrywhere I go!<br />
But round dis ole place Ise a-goin' to stay;<br />
Dar's one spot left, they say, where I can evermore remain;<br />
Dar kindness makes my poor heart throb and thrill;<br />
Ise growin' ole and weary, so I'll neber roam again<br />
From de little log cabin on de hill!<br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
